The goal of this PAthogene PROgnosis System is to prognose severe infection events with fungi on agricultural plants. 

It is based on my [thesis](https://macau.uni-kiel.de/receive/dissertation_diss_00023094) where the theory behind the machine learning algorithms, the interpolation methods and the pathogen specific aggregation procedures are explained.
